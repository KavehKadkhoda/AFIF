AFIF: Automatically Finding Important Features in Community Evolution Prediction for Dynamic Social Networks

We present AFIF, Automatically Finding Important Features, an efficient solution to examine communities' structural features and also to find a proper subset of promising features in order to predict the upcoming changes of social networks. 

In this work, we study social networks at a community structure level to predict communities' evolution over time. 

AFIF chooses an appropriate subset of features in prediction of community evolution while maintaining an impressive performance.
